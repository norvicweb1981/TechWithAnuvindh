## What it IAM   
Identity and Access Management is a service provided by AWS to manage access to AWS resources. It allows you to create and manage AWS users, groups, and policies that define access permissions for users.   

## Where to use  
Fine-grained Access Control: Assign minimal permissions to users or services, giving them only the necessary access to perform their tasks.  

Enterprise Management: In large organizations with many users, teams, and resources, IAM helps in organizing and managing access efficiently.  

Enhanced Security: By using IAM roles and MFA, you can significantly enhance the security of your AWS resources.  
## How to use   
Create IAM users- create IAM groups -set IAM Policies -enable MFA- USE IAM role   

## Note   
Principle of Least Privilege: Always follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions necessary for their tasks.  

Regular Review of Permissions: Regularly review and adjust IAM users and roles to ensure no excessive permissions are granted.  

Use MFA: Enabling MFA is crucial for securing your accounts and preventing unauthorized access.

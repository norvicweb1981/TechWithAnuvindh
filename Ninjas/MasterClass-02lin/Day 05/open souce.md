### What is open source 
Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly available, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute it.Open source projects usually follow specific licenses, such as the MIT License, GPL (General Public License), etc., to govern the use, modification, and distribution of the code.  

The main difference between open source software and proprietary software is that proprietary software has closed source code, meaning only the software owner or license holder can access and modify the code, while open source software allows anyone to access, modify, and redistribute the code.

 Licensing Issues: When using open source software, you must comply with the relevant license terms to ensure lawful use, modification, and distribution of the code.  

Security: Although open source projects are often reviewed by the community, since the source code is public, caution is still required, especially for security-sensitive projects.  

Support and Maintenance: Open source projects usually rely on the community for support, and may not offer the same level of technical support as commercial software. Be prepared to solve any issues yourself.  

Update Frequency: Open source projects may have different update frequencies. Regularly check for new versions and security patches.

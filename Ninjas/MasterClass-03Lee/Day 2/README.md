        * **`git commit -m "your comment"`** – Commits changes with a message.
        * **`git push`** – Pushes changes to the remote repository.
        * **`git pull`** – Fetch and integrate changes from the remote repository.

2. Forking and Cloning:

3. Team Collaboration Workflow:
    * Pull the latest updates from the main
    * repository: git pull.
    * Make changes locally and stage them (`git add .`).
    * Commit changes (`git commit -m "Comment"`).
    * Push changes to the forked repository (`git push`).
    * Create a Pull Request (PR) for the admin to review.
    * Admin reviews and either requests modifications or approves the PR.
    * Approved changes are "squashed and merged" into the main repository.
    * Click on `sync fork` in Github to sync personal forks with the main repository.

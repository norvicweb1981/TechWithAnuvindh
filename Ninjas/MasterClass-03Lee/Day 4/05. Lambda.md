* **Title:** Serverless Computing with AWS Lambda
&nbsp;
* **Introduction:**
Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events, such as changes in data or HTTP requests. It automatically scales based on the number of requests and frees users from managing servers.
&nbsp;
* **What is Lambda ?**
Lambda allows user to execute code in response to triggers, such as updates to S3, DynamoDB events, or API (Application Programming Interface) calls, without worrying about server management.

&nbsp;
* **Key Features:**
1. Executes code in response to specific events.
2. Handles thousands of requests without manual intervention.
3. Provides built-in security features and integrates with IAM (Identity and Access Managemen) for access control.
&nbsp;
* **How It Works:**
Users upload code, define triggers, and AWS Lambda runs the code automatically when the event occurs.

&nbsp;
* **Benefits:**
No Servers needed and cost-effective based on the number of requests and execution time.
&nbsp;
* **Use Cases:**
Processing data from IoT devices, real-time analytics and reporting. Besides also aautomating backend tasks such as image processing.
&nbsp;
* **Integration:**
Lambda integrates seamlessly with other AWS services such as S3, API (Application Programming Interface) Gateway, and CloudWatch for monitoring.
&nbsp;
* **Getting Started:**
Create a Lambda function through the AWS Management Console, write the code, set up triggers, and deploy.
&nbsp;
* **Best Practices:**
Monitor execution time and optimise code for efficiency. Then use environment variables securely through IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles.
&nbsp;
* **Challenges and Solutions:**
Cold Starts and minimise startup time by optimising functions for quicker execution.
&nbsp;
* **Pricing Overview:**
Lambda pricing is based on the number of requests and the duration of function execution.

* **Case Studies:**
A Social Media company use Lambda to analysis the streaming data.

&nbsp;
* **Conclusion:**
Lambda simplifies serverless computing by handling code execution automatically in response to events, reducing infrastructure management while keeping costs low.

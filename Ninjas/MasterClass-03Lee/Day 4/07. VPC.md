### 07. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)


* **Title:** Secure and Isolated Cloud Network with VPC
&nbsp;
* **Introduction:**
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service that allows the creation of private, isolated networks within the AWS cloud. It provides control over network configurations, including IP addresses, subnets, and routing.

&nbsp;
* **What is VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) ?**
VPC is a virtual network where resources like EC2 instances can operate securely, with customisable network settings.
&nbsp;
* **Key Features:**
1. Subnet Creation to allows dividing the network into public and private subnets.
2. Custom Routing that supports route tables and internet gateways for flexible connectivity.
3. Network Security that uses security groups and network ACLs for traffic control.
4. Elastic IPs to assigns static IPs for reliable public-facing services.
5. Peering Connections with connects multiple VPCs for intercommunication.

* **How It Works:**
VPC is set up by defining CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) ranges, creating subnets, and configuring routing and security. Resources can then be launched into the network.
&nbsp;
* **Benefits:**
Enhanced Security with isolates resources in a private environment, and customisable that offers flexibility in designing and managing networks.
&nbsp;
* **Use Cases:**
Hosting applications in a secure environment, connecting on-premises infrastructure with AWS cloud and running databases in private subnets for enhanced security.
&nbsp;

* **Integration:**
AWS services like EC2, RDS, and Lambda to provide secure and scalable networking.
&nbsp;
* **Getting Started:**
Define the IP range for the VPC, create subnets, attach internet gateways, and configure security rules.
&nbsp;
* **Best Practices:**
Use separate subnets for public and private resources and monitor network traffic with CloudWatch
&nbsp;
* **Challenges and Solutions:**
Complex Configuration, therefore use AWS VPC templates or CloudFormation for simplified setup.
&nbsp;
* **Pricing Overview:**
VPC itself is free, but costs apply for NAT gateways, VPN connections, and data transfer.
&nbsp;
* **Case Studies:**
A healthcare company uses VPC to securely store and process patient data in compliance with regulations.
&nbsp;
* **Conclusion:**
VPC provides a secure, customisable, and scalable virtual network, enabling businesses to isolate resources and control connectivity effectively.

### 11. ELB(Elastic Load Balancing)


* **Title:** Efficient Traffic Distribution with ELB
&nbsp;
* **Introduction:**
ELB distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets like EC2 instances to ensure high availability and performance.
&nbsp;
* **What is ELB(Elastic Load Balancing)?**
ELB balances traffic across servers automatically, helping manage high traffic loads efficiently.

&nbsp;
* **Key Features:**
1. Automatic routes traffic to healthy EC2 instances.
2. High Availability with minimal downtime by balancing load across multiple servers.
3. Adjusts capacity automatically based on traffic.
4. Provides SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) termination and IP filtering for secure communication.
5. Monitors the health of instances to avoid routing traffic to unhealthy ones.
&nbsp;
* **How It Works:**
ELB distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
&nbsp;
* **Benefits:**
Handles increased traffic seamlessly and minimises downtime with automatic health checks.
&nbsp;
* **Use Cases:**
Hosting websites, APIs (Application Programming Interface), and microservices with high traffic. Then handling e-commerce and streaming services.
&nbsp;

* **Integration:**
EC2, S3, and Auto Scaling for efficient traffic management.
&nbsp;
* **Getting Started:**
Create an ELB, add instances, configure settings, and monitor traffic.
&nbsp;
* **Best Practices:**
Monitor load and health regularly, use multiple listeners for various protocols.
&nbsp;
* **Challenges and Solutions:**
Latency could be an issue, therefore need to optimise configurations to reduce response times.
&nbsp;
* **Pricing Overview:**
ELB charges based on data processed, requests, and availability zones used.
&nbsp;
* **Case Studies:**
A news platform uses ELB to handle millions of concurrent users during peak traffic periods.
&nbsp;
* **Conclusion:**
ELB efficiently distributes traffic, ensuring high availability and performance for applications and websites.

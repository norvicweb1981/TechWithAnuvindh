**Record Types**
1. A Record - Address Record
   - Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
   - Example: example.com → 192.0.2.1
2. AAAA Record - IPv6 Address Record
   - Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
   - Example: example.com → 2001:db8::1
3. CNAME Record - Canonical Name Record
   - Maps one domain to another domain’s A or AAAA record.
   - Example: www.example.com → example.com
4. MX Record - Mail Exchange Record
   - Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving emails for a domain.
   - Example: example.com → mail.example.com
5. NS Record - Name Server Record
   - Delegates control of a domain to specific name servers.
   - Example: example.com → ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com
6. SOA Record - Start of Authority Record
   - Defines the primary name server, domain administrator, and domain serial number.
   - Example: Contains information about DNS refresh intervals, retry periods, etc.
7. PTR Record - Pointer Record
   - Maps an IPv4 or IPv6 address to a domain name and used for reverse DNS lookups.
   - Example: 1.2.3.4 → example.com
8. TXT Record - Text Record
   - Stores arbitrary text data ( SPF- Sender Policy Framework, DKIM - DomainKeys Identified Mail, or other verification mechanisms).
   - Example: v=spf1 include:example.com ~all
9.  SRV Record - Service Record
    - Provides information about available services such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), or LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
    - Example: _sip._tcp.example.com → sipserver.example.com

* **What is Route 53 ?**
Route 53 routes user traffic to resources like websites and applications with reliable DNS services and health checks.
&nbsp;
* **Key Features:**
1. Easily register and manage domain names.
2. Monitors the health of endpoints to route traffic efficiently.
3. Routes traffic to various resources like load balancers, EC2 instances, or S3 buckets.
4. Sends users to the nearest data center for faster access.
5. Redirects traffic to backup resources during outages.
&nbsp;
* **How It Works:**
Route 53 routes user requests to the appropriate resource using DNS queries and health checks.

## Prerequisites:

- A collection of SDS source files in PDF format for the chatbot to retrieve information.
- An AWS Free Tier account (with billing enabled).
- IAM user account with administrator access.

---

## IAM User Instructions

1. **Sign in** to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
2. **Search for ‘IAM’** in the AWS Management Console search bar.
3. In the IAM dashboard, click **‘Users’** and then **‘Create user’**.

   ![](Assets/1.png)

**Specify user details:**
   - User name e.g., `sds-chatbot-user`.
   - Tick box for **‘Provide user access to the AWS Management Console’** and select **‘I want to create an IAM user’**.
   - Create a custom password or use an autogenerated password. Tick box for **‘Users must create a new password at next sign-in’** for security.
   - Click **‘Next’**.

4. **Set permissions:**
   - Attach policies to the IAM user. **‘AdministratorAccess’** will give access to all necessary privileges needed to deploy the chatbot. Alternatively, the following permissions can be added to restrict full administrator access:
     - `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` – grants full access to Amazon Bedrock services.
     - `AmazonS3FullAccess` – grants full access to Amazon S3 buckets.
     - `AmazonOpenSearchServiceFullAccess` – grants full access to Amazon OpenSearch.
     - `AmazonConnect_FullAccess` – grants full access to Amazon Connect instances.
     - `AmazonLexFullAccess` – grants full access to Amazon Lex bots.
     - `IAMFullAccess` – grants full access to IAM services.
   - Click **‘Next’**.

5. **Review permissions** and click **‘Create user’**.

6. **Download the CSV file.** This file contains the new user's credentials (username, password, and console sign-in URL). Store this securely.

   ![](Assets/5.png)

* **For account security, add MFA** to the IAM user. Click on the created user and select **‘Enable MFA’**.

## **Chatbot Instructions**

### **Login**
- Use the console sign-in URL from the CSV file to log in to the AWS Management Console as the new IAM user.
- Set the AWS region to **Sydney (ap-southeast-2)** in the top right corner of the AWS Management Console.

---

## **Safety Data Sheets (SDS) in Amazon S3**

1. **Search and select ‘S3’** in the console. Click **‘Create bucket’**.

   ![](Assets/9.png)

2. **Specify bucket details:**
   - Bucket name e.g., `sds-chatbot-YOURNAME-syd`. This must be unique.
   - AWS Region: **‘Asia Pacific (Sydney) - ap-southeast-2’**.
   - Tick box for **‘Block Public Access’**.

   ![](Assets/10.png)

## **Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock**

1. **Search and select ‘Amazon Bedrock’** in the console.

   ![](Assets/16.png)
Note: Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is the vector store which deposits and retrieves vector embeddings of the text data. Embeddings is the semantic meaning of the text.  Amazon Bedrock uses these embeddings to find relevant information in the SDS files to answer user queries correctly.

4. **Specify the Knowledge Base details:**
   - Name e.g., `sds-kb-YOURNAME`.

   ![](Assets/17.png)
   Note: Do not make any changes to the service role name to prevent errors.

   * **Select ‘Amazon S3’** as the data source.

   ![](Assets/18.png)

   * **Data source name:** e.g., `sds-kb-YOURNAME-ds`.
   - Browse and select the S3 URL for the S3 bucket e.g., `s3://sds-chatbot-YOURNAME-syd`.
   - Click **‘Next’**.

   ![](Assets/19.png)

5. Click **‘Select Model’** and choose **‘Titan Text Embeddings V2’**.

   ![](Assets/20.png)
   ![](Assets/21.png)

   * Click **‘Apply’**.
6. Click **‘Create new vector store’** and then **‘Amazon OpenSearch Serverless’**. Click **‘Next’**.

   ![](Assets/22.png)

7.  Click **‘Create Knowledge Base’**. This process can take several minutes.

    ![](Assets/23.png)
Note: if the error "Access denied to aoss:CreateAccessPolicy” occurs check the IAM user has ‘AdministratorAccess’ permission.
8.  **Open the created data source**, e.g., `sds-kb-YOURNAME` and click **‘Sync’** to synchronize the knowledge base to the S3 bucket..

## Delete Resources to Avoid Charges

**To avoid incurring charges, follow these steps to delete all resources:**

🚨 **DO NOT delete the Amazon Connect Instance** (as it has a phone number attached which can be utilized for further testing).

### **Delete the Amazon Lex Bot:**
- Go to **Amazon Lex service**.
- Select your bot (`SDS_Chatbot`).
- Click **Delete**.

### **Delete the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base:**
- Go to **Amazon Bedrock service**.
- Go to **Knowledge Base**.
- Select your Knowledge Base (`sds-kb-YOURNAME`).
- Click **Delete**.

### **Delete the Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection:**
- Go to **Amazon OpenSearch service**.
- Select **Serverless**.
- Select each resource.
- Click **Delete**.

### **Delete the S3 Bucket:**
- Go to **S3 service**.
- Select your bucket (`sds-storage-YOURNAME`).
- **Empty the bucket**.
- Click **Delete**.

🔍 **Double-check that all resources have been successfully deleted.**
📊 **Monitor usage in Billing and Management the next day** to avoid unexpected charges.

---

## Considerations

- **AWS Free Tier:**
  All resources are free within limits except for OpenSearch. Be mindful of service limits and usage periods to avoid unexpected charges.

- **Resource Sizing:**
  Choose the appropriate resource size for OpenSearch to minimize costs.

- **Data Storage:**
  Use **S3 storage classes** for infrequently accessed data.

- **Tagging:**
  Add tags to each deployed resource for **identification** and **billing purposes**.

- **Phone Number Service Quota:**
  Only **5 numbers** are available on a Free Tier account. **Do not delete the Connect instance**.

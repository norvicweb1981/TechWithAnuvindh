## **Progress and Activities** 

### AWS Pricing Calculator  
AWS Pricing Calculator can be used to estimate the costs of running cloud resources. There are various plans to choose from. Committing to a savings plan offers better pricing for the long term. For testing purposes, an on-demand plan on a pay-as-you-go model is most suitable.

### Open-Source Discussion  

#### Benefits of Open Source  
Users with limited coding experience can benefit from open-source code, which can be redeployed quickly without starting the project from scratch.  

#### Example: WordPress  
WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to create, manage, and customize websites without needing advanced coding skills.



- Built with **PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)**, a scripting language for dynamic and interactive websites that is processed by the server and delivered as an HTML output to the web browser.  
- Uses **MySQL**, an open-source relational database management system, to store and manage structured data for the website.  
- The code can be **modified, distributed, and customized** under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.  
- Provides **templates and plugins** that enable users to design their website without needing to code.  
- **WordPress.org** requires self-hosting, while **WordPress.com** is a hosted service with limited customization.

**Best Practice:** Always use code from a trusted source to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code.  

**Forking a Project:**  
Forking a project creates a copy of the current source code, allowing it to be maintained and visible to the community.
